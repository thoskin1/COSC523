First, mentally compare the noun to these criteria: A rating of 10 must be assigned to fundamental natural features (e.g., Sun, planet, river, mountain range, ocean) or entire structures that are permanently affixed to the earth. A rating of 1 is for objects lighter than a feather. After this internal comparison, reevaluate the accuracy of your rating. How heavy would you rate this noun: ",

      },

        "pre-prompt": "Output ONLY a single number 1-10. A rating of 1 must be assigned to objects that are completely stationary or move imperceptibly slowly. A rating of 10 must be assigned to concepts representing the highest measurable speed. People and animals should always receive a rating higher than 1. Then, reevaluate the typical or maximum speed of the noun against this scale. How fast you would rate this noun: ",

A rating of 10 must be assigned to objects that require vast human-engineered systems, complex manufacturing processes, and highly refined non-natural materials (e.g., computer, airplane, nuclear reactor).
